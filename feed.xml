This update represents a major step forward in our ongoing commitment to network optimization and security.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our new difficulty algorithm introduces faster adjustment responses to hash rate changes, enhanced stability against time-warp attacks, and more precise difficulty targeting. These improvements ensure a more reliable and efficient mining experience for all participants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The updated algorithm uses a rolling window of block times and implements weighted averaging that prioritizes recent blocks while considering historical data. We’ve also added guard rails to prevent extreme difficulty swings, making the network more stable and predictable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These improvements translate into a more stable mining experience with better rewards distribution. Miners will see more consistent block times, improved profitability through predictable mining rewards, and reduced orphan rates thanks to better block time consistency.&lt;/p&gt; </description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://siko-ctrl.github.io/salvium/blog/v06-series-update/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://siko-ctrl.github.io/salvium/blog/v06-series-update/</guid><category>Development</category></item><item><title>The Evolution of Privacy in Cryptocurrency</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The journey of privacy in cryptocurrency has been a fascinating evolution. From its early cypherpunk roots to today’s sophisticated solutions, we’ve seen tremendous growth in how privacy technology adapts to modern requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the early days, privacy was seen primarily as a form of resistance against surveillance. Initial privacy solutions were relatively simple, and adoption was limited mainly to tech-savvy users who prioritized anonymity above all else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the technology matured, we saw the development of more sophisticated privacy protocols. This middle period brought increased regulatory attention to privacy coins, spurring innovation in how privacy features could be implemented while maintaining compliance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today’s privacy landscape shows a remarkable balance between privacy protection and regulatory compliance. New technologies are emerging that bridge this gap, allowing users to maintain their privacy while still adhering to necessary regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salvium represents the next step in this evolution. Our approach combines robust privacy features with built-in compliance capabilities, making it suitable for both individual users and institutions. We focus on providing selective transparency, allowing users to reveal transaction details when required while maintaining privacy by default.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The future of privacy in cryptocurrency looks promising. We’re seeing growing interest from traditional financial institutions and increased integration with decentralized finance. As the industry continues to mature, we expect to see even better alignment between privacy features and regulatory frameworks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as we continue to develop and refine our privacy technology, always with an eye toward both user privacy and regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt; </description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://siko-ctrl.github.io/salvium/blog/evolution-of-privacy/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://siko-ctrl.github.io/salvium/blog/evolution-of-privacy/</guid><category>Privacy</category></item><item><title>Introducing Our New Desktop Wallet</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce the launch of our new desktop wallet, designed from the ground up to provide a seamless and secure experience for managing your digital assets.
