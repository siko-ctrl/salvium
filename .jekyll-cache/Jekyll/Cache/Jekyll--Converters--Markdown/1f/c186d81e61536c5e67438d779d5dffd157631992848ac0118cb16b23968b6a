<h4 id="qa-highlights"><strong>Q&amp;A Highlights</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Q: How does Salvium maintain privacy while ensuring regulatory compliance?</strong></p>

<p>A: Salvium implements a unique approach that we call ‚Äúselective privacy.‚Äù This allows users to maintain transaction privacy while still enabling compliance when needed. Our protocol includes features for optional transparency, making it suitable for both private and institutional use.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What sets Salvium‚Äôs privacy features apart from other cryptocurrencies?</strong></p>

<p>A: Our privacy implementation focuses on three key aspects:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Scalability without compromising privacy</li>
  <li>Optional transparency for compliance</li>
  <li>Advanced cryptographic techniques for enhanced security</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Q: How do you see privacy evolving in the cryptocurrency space?</strong></p>

<p>A: We believe privacy will become increasingly important as cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption. However, this must be balanced with regulatory requirements. Salvium is positioned to lead in this space by providing flexible privacy solutions that can adapt to evolving needs.</p>
