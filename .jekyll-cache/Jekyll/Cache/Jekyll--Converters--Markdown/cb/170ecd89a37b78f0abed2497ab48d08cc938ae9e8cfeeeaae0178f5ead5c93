I"O<p>The v0.6 series brings significant improvements to Salvium’s difficulty adjustment algorithm, enhancing network stability and mining efficiency. This update represents a major step forward in our ongoing commitment to network optimization and security.</p>

<p>Our new difficulty algorithm introduces faster adjustment responses to hash rate changes, enhanced stability against time-warp attacks, and more precise difficulty targeting. These improvements ensure a more reliable and efficient mining experience for all participants.</p>

<p>The updated algorithm uses a rolling window of block times and implements weighted averaging that prioritizes recent blocks while considering historical data. We’ve also added guard rails to prevent extreme difficulty swings, making the network more stable and predictable.</p>

<p>These improvements translate into a more stable mining experience with better rewards distribution. Miners will see more consistent block times, improved profitability through predictable mining rewards, and reduced orphan rates thanks to better block time consistency.</p>
